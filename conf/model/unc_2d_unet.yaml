# Different modes of using the unet output
# "softplus": unet output as the uncertainty map, softplus activation, loss based on Normal distribution
# "sigmoid": unet output as the pixel-wise loss weighting, sigmoid activation, loss based on L2 regularization
# "baseline": ignore unet output. Apply plain L2 reconstruction loss
unet_acti: "sigmoid"

# Hyperparam for unet_acti=="sigmoid"
# The regularization loss used on the predicted mask

# Hyperparam for unet_acti=="softplus"
# The following only take effect when unet_acti=="softplus"

# The photometric loss used for training 3DGS models
# "l2": L2 loss, used in NeRF-W

# How to use the transient mask in contrastive loss
# "thresh": only consider the contr loss for pixels whose static prob is larger than contr_weight_thresh
# "on_sim": weigh the sim with the static prob of both pixels
# "on_prob": weigh the exp-sim (prob) with the static prob of both pixels
